# LLM-Research-Technion

Welcome to the LLM-Research-Technion repository! This repository serves as the central hub for our ongoing research and development of Large Language Models (LLMs) at Technion. Our work focuses on exploring, evaluating, and implementing advanced LLM architectures to solve complex problems in systems engineering and beyond.

## Model Implementations:
Source code and scripts for various LLMs, including Transformer-based models, encoder-decoder hybrids, and instruction-tuned models.

## Research Papers:
A collection of academic papers and technical reports related to our research, including our analyses and evaluations of different LLM architectures.

## Experiments and Results:
Documentation and datasets from our experimental work, detailing the performance and behavior of different LLMs in specific tasks.

## Tools and Utilities:
Custom scripts and tools developed to facilitate LLM training, fine-tuning, and evaluation processes.

## Collaborations:
Contributions from Technion researchers and collaborators, including shared code and joint research efforts.
